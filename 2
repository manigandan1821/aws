To create a sample application in AWS CodePipeline, deploy it to an EKS cluster using ArgoCD, and integrate SonarQube in the build phase, you need the following key components:

Source Code (for a basic application)
Dockerfile (to containerize your application)
Buildspec file (to define build and test stages, including SonarQube integration)
Kubernetes Deployment and Service (to deploy your application to EKS)
ArgoCD Application YAML (to automate deployment via ArgoCD)
Let’s create a simple example:

1. Source Code
A basic Node.js application can be used for this sample.

app.js:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from AWS EKS and ArgoCD!');
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`);
});
package.json:

{
  "name": "aws-eks-argocd-sample",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Sample Node.js app deployed on EKS using ArgoCD",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
2. Dockerfile
This Dockerfile containerizes the Node.js application.

# Use official Node.js image
FROM node:14

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
3. Buildspec File with SonarQube Integration
The buildspec.yml file defines the build and testing steps in CodeBuild. We integrate SonarQube for code quality checks.

version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 14
    commands:
      - echo "Installing dependencies"
      - npm install
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Running SonarQube scan"
      - sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=aws-eks-argocd-sample \
                      -Dsonar.sources=. \
                      -Dsonar.host.url=$SONAR_HOST_URL \
                      -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building Docker image"
      - docker build -t $IMAGE_REPO_URL:$CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION .
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Pushing Docker image to ECR"
      - $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION)
      - docker push $IMAGE_REPO_URL:$CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION
artifacts:
  files:
    - app.js
    - Dockerfile
    - buildspec.yml
    - kubernetes/*
4. Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML
These files define the deployment and service in the EKS cluster.

kubernetes/deployment.yaml:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  labels:
    app: sample-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sample-app
        image: <ECR-IMAGE-URI>:<IMAGE-TAG>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
kubernetes/service.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sample-app
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: sample-app
5. ArgoCD Application YAML
This YAML file defines the ArgoCD configuration for continuous deployment.

argocd/application.yaml:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/your-repo/aws-eks-argocd-sample'
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: kubernetes
  destination:
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    namespace: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
Steps to Set Up the Pipeline:
Create an EKS Cluster and configure kubectl to communicate with it.
Set up ArgoCD on the EKS cluster by following the official ArgoCD installation guide.
Set up SonarQube for code quality analysis.
Create a CodePipeline with:
Source: GitHub/CodeCommit for storing the application code.
Build: AWS CodeBuild with the provided buildspec.yml.
Deploy: Trigger ArgoCD for deployment via the ArgoCD Application YAML.
Configure AWS ECR to push the Docker image built in CodeBuild.
Deploy to EKS: ArgoCD will automatically sync the changes to the EKS cluster.
This setup enables a fully automated CI/CD pipeline in AWS, with SonarQube for static code analysis, CodeBuild for building the app, and ArgoCD for continuous deployment to the EKS cluster.

Where and how to apply this file argocd/application.yaml 
ChatGPT said:

To apply the ArgoCD application.yaml file, you need to create it within your ArgoCD environment so that ArgoCD can monitor and manage the deployment of your application. Here’s how to apply this file:

Pre-requisites:
ArgoCD Installed on Your EKS Cluster:

Ensure ArgoCD is already installed and configured in your EKS cluster. If you haven't done this yet, follow the ArgoCD installation guide.
kubectl and ArgoCD CLI configured:

Make sure you have kubectl configured to interact with your EKS cluster.
Install the ArgoCD CLI to interact with the ArgoCD server.
Steps to Apply the ArgoCD application.yaml:
Log in to ArgoCD (via CLI): After ArgoCD is installed, you need to log in to the ArgoCD server.

# Get the ArgoCD initial password
kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o yaml
Once you have the initial admin password:

# Log in to ArgoCD
argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER>
Replace <ARGOCD_SERVER> with the actual server address of ArgoCD (this can be a load balancer address or localhost if using port forwarding).

Apply the application.yaml File:

Now that you are logged in to ArgoCD and have access to your cluster, you can apply the application.yaml file, which will configure ArgoCD to monitor your repository and deploy your application.

# Apply the ArgoCD application definition
kubectl apply -f argocd/application.yaml -n argocd
This command tells ArgoCD to track the application configuration specified in the application.yaml file and deploy the app in the default namespace of your EKS cluster.

Check the Application Status:

Once the application is created, ArgoCD will start syncing the repository and deploying it to your EKS cluster. You can check the application status via the ArgoCD web UI or CLI.

To check via the CLI:

argocd app get sample-app
This will show the status of the application, including if the deployment is successful, if it's syncing, or if there are any errors.

Sync the Application (optional):

If you want to manually sync the application (force a sync if auto-sync isn't enabled):

argocd app sync sample-app
ArgoCD UI:
You can also log in to the ArgoCD web UI using the credentials mentioned in step 1 (admin and the password you retrieved).
From the UI, you will see your application listed (in this case, sample-app), and you can monitor deployments, sync, and check logs directly.
ArgoCD Sync:
ArgoCD will continuously monitor your repository for changes. Whenever you push new commits to your GitHub or CodeCommit repository, ArgoCD will automatically deploy the new version to your EKS cluster if auto-sync is enabled (as defined in application.yaml).

This completes the setup for deploying your application to EKS using ArgoCD!
